# Usage Recommendations Fragment

This fragment describes conditions under which the model publishers believe the model will perform
as expected. 

While the [Model Training] section gives users a clear picture of the training conditions, the model
publisher may also have evidence or intuition that the model will also perform well when used in a 
different context. For instance, a model might have been trained on data from a particular
geographic region and time period, but based on some combination of intuition, previous experience,
and informal experimentation, the model publisher may be confident that it will perform similarly in
a new geographic region. This section is meant to capture that information in a systematic way,
while also providing publishers the opportunity to describe their recommendations in a more
free-form style.
