# Model Training Fragment

The Model Training fragment captures essential information about how the model was trained, including the 
compute environment, training datasets, and the date on which the model was trained. The goal of this section 
is to capture enough information that a new developer could reasonably reproduce the trained model. This also 
contributes to the ability to reproduce published model results.
