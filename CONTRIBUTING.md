# Contributing

Please review our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing to the spec.

## Spec Development

The primary methods for contributing to the spec itself are through Issues and/or Pull Requests in this repo, and 
everyone is encouraged to contribute through either of these methods. Please be sure to check existing Issues and Pull 
Requests to see if someone has already addressed your question or problem.

## Design and Direction

In addition to direct contributions to the spec itself, we welcome input and feedback on the high-level design from 
users and community members. The best way to contribute to this discussion is on the 
[`#geo-ml-model-catalog`](https://mlhubearth.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=geo-ml-model-catalog) Slack channel.
